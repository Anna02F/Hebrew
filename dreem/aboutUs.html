            Dream Seekers Academy is a premier advisory focused on providing
            comprehensive admissions support for students seeking entry into the
            world’s elite undergraduate and graduate universities.
          </p>
          <p class="text-std text-center center-block">

            with admissions experience. Each of our admissions specialists has a

            A Different Approach
          </h1>
          <p class="text-std text-center center-block">
            We believe that the approach of forcibly molding students into “Ivy
            League prospects” is misguided. Instead, empowering students to
            pursue their passions by developing their interpersonal,
            communication and leadership skills naturally turns them into elite
            University prospects.
          </p>
          <p class="text-std text-center center-block">
            We tailor the experience to the student by specifically addressing
            their weaknesses and developing their strengths with one-on-one
            guidance. Through the process – students cultivate the skills that
            help them become more confident, competent and self-reliant
            individuals.

                most other counsellors set you up on false pedestals. He points
                out a flaw (or many), and helps you rectify it. He motivates you
                to think deep within yourself. The end result is a unique to
                each student, unlike other counsellors who apply a generic theme
